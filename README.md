https://dev.to/miracool/how-to-manage-user-authentication-with-react-js-3ic5

implemented routing. Need to work on auth logic
implement json-server for using db logic. Need to rework auth to use db (launch server with "npx json-server -p 8000 db.json)
removed logic to query db. may re add later. auth working with password. used userId in localstorage for data to persist. Probably unsafe.
